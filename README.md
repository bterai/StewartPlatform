# StewartPlatform
Math model for a fixed-rotary Gough-Stewart platform to allow the use of hobby servos to adjust the lengths of six parallel legs to achieve 6-DOF motion of a platform

The model allows pitch-roll-yaw trajectories to be defined to simulate the trajectory and ensure servo angles are within allowable range of motion
